## Capstone team project showcasing our analysis into Spirit Aviation. 
- Involves 6 other team members.
- I specifically was focused on the EFE matrix and Grand Strategy Matrix although various work was done throughout other concepts.
- Presented to Professer as Final Capstone Project.
- Recieved a grade letter of A.

## Tools Used
- Excel

## Lessons Learned
- The team's success is measured by everyone's effort -- collaboration is key. 
- Communication is key -- speak up about anything you're unsure about or need help with and help others in the proccess.
- Specific research may be hard to come by and be limiting to pinpoint accuracy relating to matrix weights -- use the best data that you have access to.

## Outcome
- I am satisfied with the team's outcome of this project as well as my own.
